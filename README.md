ScottyMJacobson.github.io
=========================

Hello! This is my [GitHub user page](https://scottymjacobson.github.io), which doubles as my homepage (as soon as the scottymjacobson.com DNS records update). 

To make it, I used [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), using StartBootstrap's [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) theme as a foundation. The icons are from the illustrious [FontAwesome](fontawesome.io). There's also some simple [JQuery](http://jquery.com) going on under the hood. 

I'm in the process of making it fully [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)-powered, but for now, the site is a bit frankensteined: a combination of lack of Jekyll experience and pushing Jekyll outside its comfort zone means that only some content is dynamic (though I completed my main objective, which was to be able to change my mind incessantly on the "about me" wall of text without pushing commits to index.html.)
