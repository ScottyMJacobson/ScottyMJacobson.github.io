        Aproxymate is an HTTP proxy written in python. 
        It handles HTTP GET requests and does basic temporary caching through its companion, Memkeshed. 
        Both were built atop python's HTTPServer and TCPServer modules, utilizing HTTP for aproxymate and a custom (esoteric, pop-culture-inspired) plaintext TCP protocol (modeled after memcached's) for communication with Memkeshed. 
        A full walkthrough of the code, protocol, and their design can be found in <a href="https://scottymjacobson.github.io/aproxymate/aproxymate_presentation.html">this presentation.</a>

        Named for the stones on which Athenians cast their votes, Ostracon is a library built in Erlang and JavaScript that facilitates concurrent communication between multiple clients through a single server. 
        It is set up to simultaneously handle and push changes in state across many clients in near real-time. 
        Our goal when designing it was to eliminate boilerplate code in distributed web games; as a proof-of-concept, we built a multiplayer "snake"-like example game.
