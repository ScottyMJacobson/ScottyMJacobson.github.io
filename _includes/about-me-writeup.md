I'm a NYC-based developer, currently helping build the future of video at [Interlude](www.interlude.fm). 

I graduated Tufts in May 2015 with a CS degree and a minor in Music Engineering, spent the summer as Lead Engineer of a doomed startup, and finally stumbled upon a perfect fit at Interlude. 

In the past, I helped work on [iZotope's Iris 2](http://www.izotope.com/iris) (look for me in the [promo video!](https://youtu.be/ceY_crXdTJU)) as part of my internship at iZotope in 2014. 
Before joining the workforce, I worked on a few closed-source projects and websites for clients as a freelance developer. 

You can see some <a class="page-scroll" href="#projects">projects</a> I've worked on below, or see code that I've open-sourced at my [GitHub](http://github.com/ScottyMJacobson). 

When I'm not coding, I'm probably working on music - from my days in a high school band playing festivals, to most recently [producing and releasing music independently](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6128767/episode-featuring-stefan-weiner-hold-on-song-premiere-stream), music has always been my go-to art form. On that note, more coming soon. . .
