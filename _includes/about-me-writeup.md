Though I didn't know it at the time, I began programming when I was 12, copying and pasting snippets of ActionScript toghether to make flash games. 
I rediscovered programming as a freshman in Tufts' intro CS class, where I realized that programming is best executed as an art form, and creativity and instinct came to replace copying and pasting.
Four years later, I've graduated with a degree in Computer Science with a minor in Music Engineering. 

I love solving programs anywhere in the development stack, with an affinity for working on the backend of web stacks. 
There's something about the immediacy and scale of the web that draws me - it feels like this is the first time in history that there's this potential to conceive of something and release it to thousands of people in a matter of hours.

Professionally, I helped work on [iZotope's Iris 2](http://www.izotope.com/iris) (look for me in the [promo video!](https://youtu.be/ceY_crXdTJU)) as part of my internship at iZotope in 2014. 
Recently, I've worked on a few closed-source projects and websites for clients as a freelance developer. 
Most often, I've been coding in __Python__ and __JavaScript__, using the __Django__ and __Angular__ frameworks. 
I've also done work in __Node.js__, and feel comfortable falling back to my foundation in statically-typed
__C++__ or __C__ (on that note, I've recently been teaching myself __GoLang__ and have found that I really really like it).
I tend to enjoy learning new tools and making them work for my needs. 
Philisophically, I've become increasingly convinced that the secret to happy software development is a full outer join of [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) and [Rob Pike's 5 Rules](http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~adnan/pike.html).

When I'm not coding, I love to make music - from my days in a high school band playing festivals, to most recently [releasing music independently](http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6128767/episode-featuring-stefan-weiner-hold-on-song-premiere-stream), music has always played the role of creative release in my life. 
Some of my other hobbies over the years have included climbing, trapeze, and biking, and I've recently begun taking cooking a bit more seriously (with varying levels of success).

I'm based in NYC, and looking forward to an opportunity to build something great.
