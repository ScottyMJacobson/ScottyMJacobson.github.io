    <p id="bio">
        Solving problems with creativity and technology has been my passion for as long as I can remember. Music production's ability to combine my love for music with my love for technology has had me hooked since 2008; in my Freshman year at Tufts, Computer Science found me in a moment of serendipty. I've lived at the intersection of the two ever since. 

        I've coded in C++, C, SML, Scheme, Javascript/Jquery, HTML5, CSS3, and Objective-C, and worked with Logic Pro, Max/MSP, Reason, Final Cut, Photoshop, and Arduino.
