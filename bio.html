<p id="bio">
    Music's been my passion for as long as I can remember, and music production's ability to combine my love for music with my love for technology had me hooked in 2008. In my Freshman year at Tufts, Computer Science found me, and I've lived at the intersection of the two ever since. 

    I've coded in C++, C, SML, Scheme, Javascript/Jquery, HTML5, CSS3, and Objective-C, and worked with Logic Pro, Max/MSP, Reason, Final Cut, Photoshop, and Arduino.
